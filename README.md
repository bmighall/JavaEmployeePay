# JavaEmployeePay
This code's purpose is to demonstrate the concepts of inheritance, aggregation and abstract classes; it handles a hard-coded array of hourly, salaried or internship employees, calculates their pay based on the provided information and outputs the handled data back to the user. (The employees and "Gamershore" mentions in the code are references to an old YouTube content creation crew that used to exist in the late 2000s and early 2010s.)

The Driver is relatively simple and includes the hard-coded employee data in an array of Staff objects; it also includes the intermediate method calls and output-handling code.
StaffInfo is a base class which handles the basic information about each employee- name, address, city and state.
Staff is an abstract class that includes the overall framework of the Hourly, Internship, and Salaried classes.
Salaried, Hourly, and Internship are intermediate classes that extend the Staff abstract class; they calculate pay based on the hard-coded data from the Driver and handle data for each type of employee, as well as output employee data.
The Output text file is a copy of the text output from the console upon running the program (the file was created manually, not generated by the program).
